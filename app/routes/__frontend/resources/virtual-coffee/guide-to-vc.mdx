## Welcome to Virtual Coffee! ðŸ‘‹

<LeadText>

Onboarding processes can be confusing. This is just as true for software as it is for communities!

We get many questions such as "I have some questions or ideas; how and where should I ask this," "Do we have a channel for {'{'}something{'}'}'," "How do I find a channel in Slack," "I would like to help, how do I volunteer?" And many more!

To give you the best experience, and to get the most out of Virtual Coffee, we created the official "Virtual Coffee Guide"!

## <Link to="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</Link>

This is the most important part of Virtual Coffee. We want this community to be a welcoming, inclusive, supportive, and safe place for all our members.

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

_We take our Code of Conduct seriously._ You can find <Link to="/code-of-conduct">a copy of it</Link> on our website.

### I think someone has violated the Code of Conduct. How can I report it?

You can report your experience to our Maintainers at hello@virtualcoffee.io or anonymously at <Link to="/report-coc-violation">virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation</Link>.

## What To Expect In Virtual Coffee

### Coffees (Zoom Meetings)

<LeadText>

We have twice weekly Coffees (Zoom Meetings) on **Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET** and **Thursday at 12:00 PM ET** that last an hour.

This is a good place and time to meet and get to know other members, old and new, through casual conversations.

</LeadText>

#### How it works

After some pre-coffee chatter, the Coffee MC will do an intro with some background and important announcements while people filter in. Then we'll break the crowd into breakout rooms for more relaxed and intimate conversations.

When we move to the small group conversations, there will be a room leader and notetaker for the room. They'll explain how we do introductions and how to participate. We value our members and the ways they're most comfortable participating.

If you're here to listen and chill? No problem! If you can't turn on your camera or aren't comfortable having your camera or even sound on? Feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to have them on. We want you to be as comfortable as possible in our coffees.

#### Joining coffees

We drop the schedule and reminder in the `#announcement` channel on Slack. There will also be an announcement 10 minutes before the event start, along with the link to join. Click that button, and you will be directed to our Zoom.
